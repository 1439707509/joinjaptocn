I just want to delete the text in the bubble, extract the text in the bubble, write the extracted text into it, and delete the picture of the bubble text

The current effect is the same as ce-translated in the ce folder, which is not ideal

When deleting text, delete the text in the non-bubble area

When extracting text, the text in the non-bubble area is extracted

So I want to ask, is there any, just choose the bubble method, or the ready-made code?

The method of skipping the text in the non-bubble area, and the ready-made code are also fine

Anyway, as long as it can achieve the effect I want, no matter what method is fine.
